Each week, we will go over the commands you need for that week’s assignments. You may work together in class and on homework, but I do expect you to turn in an individual assignment that has been completed on your own and reflects your own understanding of the material. This course is meant to give you an introduction to analyzing genetic data in R, so feel free to take these assignments further where you are interested. Data is fun! 1.1 Installing R and RStudio For most of our analysis in this class, we will work with the programming language “R.” RStudio is a software that provides a nice interface for using R. The very first thing we need to do is install both R and RStudio. The following link has instructions for installing R and RStudio on any laptop: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#setup_instructions This website has many tutorials that are relevant to the types of analyses biologists need. Take a moment and install R and RStudio on your laptop. If you are going to be doing homework on a different computer, you will want to install the software on that computer as well.       1.2 Tour of RStudio Next we will take a tour of RStudio as a class. We will cover: The console Scripts Commenting Executing Commands Asking for help       1.3 Installing packages Some special functions or datasets can be downloaded as packages. To install them, we use the install.packages command: install.packages(&quot;babynames&quot;) You only have to install a package once because the package is downloaded to your computer. However, each time you use a package you will need to tell R you are using commands from that package. It’s good practice to place this at the top of your script. library(babynames)       1.4 Basic functions in R R can perform basic mathematical functions, just like a calculator. Type the following into the console and press enter: 10 + 5 # Add ten and five ## [1] 15 To do more complicated analyses, and to make scripts generalizable, we often want to assign values to objects. Type the following in your R script, then execute myvalue &lt;- 10 The arrow &lt;- is how we assign a value to an object. In general, it is better to assign values to objects rather than do math directly on the values. That is because if we want to do several different operations on myvalue but might want to change it later, we only have to change it in one place. Once you have stored a value you can print it, or you can use it to perform further mathematical functions: myvalue #print myvalue ## [1] 10   print(myvalue) #print myvalue ## [1] 10 There’s really no difference between these two ways to print an object   myvalue + 5 #add 5 to myvalue ## [1] 15   newvalue &lt;- myvalue + 5   newvalue ## [1] 15 Note: You can choose any name you want for an object, but be careful! The name should be short (you may have to type it many times), but informative (so you don’t get it confused with other objects). You cannot use spaces and you cannot begin an object name with a number. You can use capitalization and underscore to your advantage, for example: thisIsAnObject or this_is_an_object   1.4.1 Exercise: Write a script to find out what fraction of your life you’ve been at UC Davis Include objects for your age and the number of years you’ve been at Davis. Have the script print the answer.       1.5 Classes R can work with more than just numbers, it can handle a variety of data formats. You can use the function class to check the type of data: class(myvalue) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot;   But what happens if we assign an object to something other than a number? season &lt;- &quot;fall&quot; class(season) ## [1] &quot;character&quot;   Two somewhat confusing classes are character and factor. character means a string of letters while factor represents categorical data. For plotting and summarizing, we often want factor data. We can convert character data to factor data using the as.factor command: season_factor &lt;- as.factor(season) class(season_factor) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot;       1.6 Vectors and dataframes Usually we want to look at more than one number or value at once. For a single set of values, we can use a vector. To make a vector, we use the c() function (c stands for combine) seasons &lt;- c(&quot;fall&quot;,&quot;winter&quot;,&quot;spring&quot;,&quot;summer&quot;)   Perhaps the most common way to format data is in a dataframe. This is basically a spreadsheet, like you would make in Excel. R has a few example dataframes that we can use. We installed one earlier when we installed the babynames package. Look at the top of this dataframe (the head command gives just the first 5 entries): head(babynames) ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1880 F Mary 7065 0.0724 ## 2 1880 F Anna 2604 0.0267 ## 3 1880 F Emma 2003 0.0205 ## 4 1880 F Elizabeth 1939 0.0199 ## 5 1880 F Minnie 1746 0.0179 ## 6 1880 F Margaret 1578 0.0162 dim(babynames) # how many rows and columns are in the dataframe? ## [1] 1924665 5 dim gives you the dimensions of the dataframe.   Remember, we can always use ? to ask for help. If we want a description of the babynames dataframe: ?babynames       1.7 Subsetting Sometimes we want to examine a specific portion of the data. There are several ways to do this. For a two-dimensional dataframe you can use square bracket notation [x,y] where x is the rows you want and y is the columns you want. Like this: babynames[1:4,c(2,3)] #take the first four rows and columns 2 &amp; 3 ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## sex name ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 F Mary ## 2 F Anna ## 3 F Emma ## 4 F Elizabeth Notice the : gives me all the integers between 1 and 4.   You can also ask for columns by name using the $ notation. This means you can use the column name to ask for a single column out of the dataframe. Note that this does not work for rows. head(babynames$name) ## [1] &quot;Mary&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Emma&quot; &quot;Elizabeth&quot; &quot;Minnie&quot; &quot;Margaret&quot;   You can use the subset function to ask for rows that meet certain criteria. Notice the double ==. You use this when you are comparing values. myname &lt;- &quot;Rachael&quot; mydata &lt;- subset(babynames,name==myname) # take just the entries where name = &quot;Rachael&quot; head(mydata) ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## year sex name n prop ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1880 F Rachael 12 0.000123 ## 2 1881 F Rachael 8 0.0000809 ## 3 1882 F Rachael 8 0.0000692 ## 4 1883 F Rachael 9 0.0000750 ## 5 1884 F Rachael 7 0.0000509 ## 6 1885 F Rachael 8 0.0000564 dim(mydata) ## [1] 158 5       1.8 Plotting R is great for plotting. The simplest type of plot is just an x,y scatterplot: plot(mydata$year,mydata$prop) Use ? to look at the options for plotting. For example, here I add more informative axis labels and choose a nice color for the points: plot(mydata$year,mydata$prop, ylab=&quot;Proportion of babies&quot;, xlab=&quot;Year&quot;, col=&quot;aquamarine4&quot;) Notice that I used new lines (returns) to make this more readable. R doesn’t care where you put white space, so use it to make your code as organized as possible.   Of course, it’s better if color is informative, so lets use it to learn something. Isn’t it weird that there are a bunch of points at 0 and other points with higher proportions during the same time frame? Maybe those points are different in some way. Lets try this: plot(mydata$year,mydata$prop, ylab=&quot;Proportion of babies&quot;, xlab=&quot;Year&quot;, col=as.factor(mydata$sex)) 1.8.1 Exercise: Describe this plot in plain english. What conclusions can we draw?         1.9 Homework Each week, you will submit a script for homework. While most of the concepts you will need will be taught during section, you may have to look up some commands online (remember, Google is your friend!). The top of your script should contain commented lines with the following: #Name #Date #EVE 109 Homework #Week ##   I should be able to execute the script. When printed answers are expected, you should store them in an object and have a line of code above should have a comment telling me where the answer is printed. For example: #Answer to Question 1 print(myvalue) ## [1] 10   If the answer requires a plot, follow the same format, with a comment indicating that this plot answers a homework question: #Answer to Question 2 plot(mydata$year,mydata$prop)   Show your work and comment your code. You will only receive full credit for clean, organized code   1.9.1 Homework 1: Write a script that does the following: Plot the use of your name over time (Or pick a different name). Only include points for one sex. What proportion of babies had your name when it was most popular? In which year was your name most popular? "],["molecular-markers.html", "Week 2 Molecular Markers 2.1 Paths 2.2 Reading in data from spreadsheets 2.3 Simple capture recapture example 2.4 Homework", " Week 2 Molecular Markers 2.1 Paths For this course, I will upload the datasets you need to this website and you will download them to your own computer. You will then need to figure out how tell R where to find them. You can find out what directory you are currently in using the getwd() command: getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/rachaelbay/Documents/Courses/Molecular Ecology/2021/Website&quot; Directories are hierarchical: the represent folders within folders just like you view them when you navigate with your mouse. You can also set which directory R will use to look for files. This is called your ‘working directory’ and you can set it using setwd(). For example, if I create a folder called \"EVE109 inside my documents folder where I want to store all my materials for this class, I can then tell R I want it to look in that directory for files: setwd(&quot;~/Documents/EVE109&quot;) If you get an error that your file cannot be found, a good first step is to check your working directory.       2.2 Reading in data from spreadsheets Today we will be working with data from the paper we read in class. You can download the dataset here A lot of data we use is stored in spreadsheets. However, when we store them in a normal Excel format (.xlsx) they come with a lot of extra formatting that R has trouble reading. One way to avoid this is to store them in a comma separated value format (.csv). Open “wombats.csv” in a text editor and look at it. It’s not easy for us to read, but you can see that it is a very simple format where each entry is separated by a comma. You were able to open it in a spreadsheet program and R can read it easily. If you are making your own data, you can save spreadsheets as .csv files from most spreadsheet programs. Now we want to read that data into RStudio. We can do that using the command read.csv. Remember do assign the resulting data frame to an object: data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/wombats.csv&quot;) # Read in a file Remember, we can look at the top of the dataframe using head: head(data) ## No.captures total males females ## 1 1 25 18 7 ## 2 2 11 7 4 ## 3 3 10 7 3 ## 4 4 10 6 4 ## 5 5 9 6 3 ## 6 6 11 6 5 This is data from the paper we read this week by Banks et al. (2003) using genetic analysis to monitor northern hairy-nosed wombats. The table represents the data shown in Figure 1, so individuals have already been identified and we’re looking at the number of times each was recaptured.       2.3 Simple capture recapture example Next we will learn a simple way to make population size estimations. We will use the capwire package to do this. Remember how to install and load a package? install.packages(&quot;capwire&quot;) library(capwire) The manual for capwire can be found online here   Okay, now lets make up some data. Luckily, capwire has a function that allows you to simulate data. Look up the function simCapture. Notice there are three different arguments we need to specify (we can ignore return.cap.probs because it has a default that we do not want to change). Using this function we’ll simulate a population of 300, from which we have 50 samples. This distribution function just means that every individual has an equal probability of being captured. sim &lt;- simCapture(n=300,s=50,dist.func=drawCapRatesUnif(0.1,1)) # Simulate capture data sim ## capture.class No.Ind ## 1 1 39 ## 2 2 4 ## 3 3 1 Now that we have simulated data, we can use one of the fitEcm function to estimate population size. What arguments do we need for that function? Notice that the help page tells you what format your data should be in. ecm &lt;- fitEcm(data=sim,max.pop=500) # estimate population size The fitEcm page also describes that output. We are most interested in the population size estimate, which is called ml.pop.size. We can extract that using: ecm$ml.pop.size ## [1] 187 How much uncertainty is there in our estimate? We can use bootstrap resampling to create confidence intervals. Look up the command boostrapCapwire boot &lt;- bootstrapCapwire(x=ecm,bootstraps=1000,CI=c(0.025,0.975)) # estimate confidence intervals boot ## $ml.pop.size ## [1] 187 ## ## $conf.int ## 2.5% 97.5% ## 105 500 Using this 95% confidence interval means there is a 95% chance the real answer is within that range. Why is it so large?! What happens if we have more samples?       2.4 Homework Now that we know how to estimate population sizes, we will use the wombat data from before. Start a new script for this. 2.4.1 Homework 2: Write a script that does the following: Read in “wombats.csv” Estimate the total population size. Estimate confidence intervals for the total population size. Estimate male and female population sizes. What is the ratio of males to females in this population?

This week, we’ll learn a few more ways to manipulate dataframes. This time we’ll use the built in palmerpenguins dataset: install.packages(&quot;palmerpenguins&quot;) library(palmerpenguins) head(penguins) ## # A tibble: 6 × 9 ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_… body_mass_g sex year mean ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Adelie Torger… 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male 2007 997. ## 2 Adelie Torger… 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema… 2007 1011. ## 3 Adelie Torger… 40.3 18 195 3250 fema… 2007 876. ## 4 Adelie Torger… NA NA NA NA &lt;NA&gt; 2007 NA ## 5 Adelie Torger… 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema… 2007 925. ## 6 Adelie Torger… 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male 2007 975.

The second column gives the populations from which the individual was sampled. The third column gives the year of sampling. The remaining columns give the microsatellite data. Each individual has two numbers which represent the fragment lengths (read on a gel). If the two fragment lengths are the same, the individual is a heterozygote. If they are different, the individual is a homozygote. We will use the package adegenet to read in the microsatellite data and calculate heterozygosity. The manual for this package is here. Install the package and call the library: install.packages(&quot;adegenet&quot;) library(adegenet)   The first thing we need to do is let the adegenet read in the microsatellite data. We can do this with the df2genind. Let’s ask for help on that command: ?df2genind Look at the arguments. How can we format our allele data to meet the requirements of the package? alleles &lt;- data[,4:ncol(data)] The function ncol gives us the number of columns. So here we are asking for all columns except the first three, which do not contain genotype data.

Start a new script for your homework 3.3.1 Homework 3: Write a script that does the following: Read in “genotypes.csv” and subset the dataframe to Mt Buller samples only. How many samples do you have from each year? Calculate mean observed heterozygosity for each year. Put these into a single dataframe. Calculate mean expected heterozygosity for each year. Add these to the dataframe from question 2. Plot mean expected heterozygosity over time. Add a vertical lines to your plot to show when introductions took place (hint - use the abline command) "],["population-structure.html", "Week 4 Population Structure 4.1 The aggregate and apply functions 4.2 Running a clustering analysis and deciding on a K value 4.3 The Q matrix 4.4 Plotting 4.5 Homework", " Week 4 Population Structure 4.1 The aggregate and apply functions Today we’ll two useful functions that you can use for dataframes, apply and aggregate. Let’s use the palmerpenguins dataset again: library(palmerpenguins) head(penguins) ## # A tibble: 6 × 9 ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_… body_mass_g sex year mean ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Adelie Torger… 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male 2007 997. ## 2 Adelie Torger… 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema… 2007 1011. ## 3 Adelie Torger… 40.3 18 195 3250 fema… 2007 876. ## 4 Adelie Torger… NA NA NA NA &lt;NA&gt; 2007 NA ## 5 Adelie Torger… 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema… 2007 925. ## 6 Adelie Torger… 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male 2007 975.   One thing we might want to do is find out which individual has the highest value for each column. We can use the apply function to do the same thing to each column: ?apply apply(penguins[,3:6],MARGIN=2,which.max) ## bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 186 20 216 170 Notice that we only used columns 3-6 because these are numeric (rather than categorical). The second argument, MARGIN, is asking whether we should be doing the function for each row (MARGIN=1), or each column (MARGIN=2). The final argument is the function we want to use. which.max asks for the index (in this case, which row) has the maximum value.   Another useful function is aggregate. Sometimes you might want to summarize groups within a dataframe. aggregate does this easily. For example, what if we want to average values for each species: ?aggregate aggregate(penguins[,3:6],by=list(penguins$species),mean) ## Group.1 bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 1 Adelie NA NA NA NA ## 2 Chinstrap 48.83382 18.42059 195.8235 3733.088 ## 3 Gentoo NA NA NA NA This gives us the mean for each set of rows that share a value in the “species” column. The second argument, by, tells how to group. The third argument is the function to use.   These commands will come in handy today! Let’s take just the quantitative data for a moment:       4.2 Running a clustering analysis and deciding on a K value The example file for use in class today can be downloaded here A common way to analyze population structure is using hierarchical clustering. Probably the most heavily used program to do this is called STRUCTURE. However, we’ll stick to similar tools you can use in R. Today we’ll use LEA for our clustering analysis. LEA cannot be downloaded from the normal R database, so use the following code: install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;LEA&quot;) Then load the library library(LEA)   For the analysis today, we’re going to use SNP data. Open the file you downloaded called week4_example.geno using a text editor. This file is in geno format. That means there is one line per individual and genotypes are coded as 0,1,or 2. 0 and 2 are homozygotes and 1 is a heterozygote. 9 means missing data. Notice that this only works when you are looking at SNPs with just 2 alleles (biallelic).   We’ll use the package LEA to read this file in and look at population structure. Make sure you have the right path!! project &lt;- snmf(&quot;data/week4_example.geno&quot;, K = 1:5, entropy = TRUE, repetitions = 10, project = &quot;new&quot;) Remember what K values are? That means ‘how many populations should we try to split this data in to?’ Here we run 10 repetitions per K value. That’s because each run is slightly different so you want to have confidence in your answer. You’ll see what entropy means in a second. You’ll get a bunch of output in your console when you run this command. It will also create a new folder on your computer called “example.snmf.” It contains a bunch of different files for each run of the clustering program. We will be able to use these files to analyze and visualize our results.   Now we’ll chose the “best” value of K. Know that there are several ways to do this and they don’t always agree, so this should be interpreted with caution. Here we will use cross-entropy loss. This basically asks how consistently our model is able to categorize the samples. The lower the cross-entropy the better the model is doing. Let’s plot all the values of K: plot(project,col=&quot;blue&quot;,pch=19)   When I ran this, K=4 had the lowest cross entropy. This plot might look slightly different each time you run it.       4.3 The Q matrix Now that we’ve decided which value of K to look at, we can look at the ancestry estimates for each individual. qmatrix &lt;- Q(project,K=4,run=1)   This command pulls out the ancestry matrix (called the Q matrix) for the first run with K=3. Let’s look at the Q matrix. head(qmatrix) ## V1 V2 V3 V4 ## [1,] 0.092847300 0.123994000 0.783059000 0.000099991 ## [2,] 0.054526300 0.000099982 0.945274000 0.000099982 ## [3,] 0.000099982 0.464003000 0.535797000 0.000099982 ## [4,] 0.000099990 0.127733000 0.539265000 0.332902000 ## [5,] 0.321161000 0.678639000 0.000099982 0.000099982 ## [6,] 0.000099991 0.045481200 0.061011000 0.893408000   Here, each row is an individual and each column is one of the inferred clusters. First, lets give the individuals “IDs” as rownames. You’ll see that this is important later. Next, one thing we could do is look at which cluster has the highest ancestry for each individual. The which.max function just gives you the index (which column in this case) of the highest value. rownames(qmatrix) &lt;- 1:nrow(qmatrix) maxCluster &lt;- apply(qmatrix,1,which.max) maxCluster ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ## 3 3 3 3 2 4 2 3 4 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 3 1 4 1 1 4 1 3 2 1 3 4 3 4 2 ## 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 ## 2 2 4 3 1 4 4 2 4 4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 1   If we pretend maxCluster gives refers to the population from which the individual came, we can use the aggregate function to look at average cluster membership across each population: aggregate(qmatrix,by=list(maxCluster),mean) ## Group.1 V1 V2 V3 V4 ## 1 1 0.72587900 0.14417849 0.02384987 0.10609268 ## 2 2 0.08609898 0.83366508 0.04827967 0.03195629 ## 3 3 0.02155977 0.10715201 0.77054985 0.10073838 ## 4 4 0.09460612 0.03990685 0.04181115 0.82367583 NOTE: Although we are using maxCluster as an indicator of population here, usually we would use some sort of a priori information we had, such as geographic location or maybe morphological species, depending on our question. This distinction will be important for your homework!       4.4 Plotting Now lets plot the ancestry results. Basically, we just want to make a barplot of the qmatrix. You can do that with the barchart function in the LEA package: barchart(project, K=4, run=1, border=NA, space=0) ## $order ## [1] 5 7 10 11 13 14 25 31 32 33 39 44 6 9 19 22 28 30 34 37 38 40 41 48 15 16 18 20 21 ## [30] 23 26 36 43 45 47 49 50 1 2 3 4 8 12 17 24 27 29 35 42 46 We can also try to label each bar with information. For example, lets try to label with the population assignment that we inferred, maxCluster: barchart(project, K=4, run=1, border=NA, space=0) -&gt; bp axis(1,at=1:length(bp$order),label=maxCluster[bp$order],las=2,cex.axis=0.4)   The grayscale is boring!! R has many many options for color packages and you could even make one of your own! For example, here is a fun one inspired by favorite La Croix flavors! install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;johannesbjork/LaCroixColoR&quot;) And now use it in our bar chart: library(LaCroixColoR) my.cols=lacroix_palette(&quot;PassionFruit&quot;,n=4,type=&quot;discrete&quot;) barchart(project, K=4, run=1, border=NA, space=0,col=my.cols) -&gt; bp axis(1,at=1:length(bp$order),label=maxCluster[bp$order],las=2,cex.axis=0.4) 4.5 Homework For homework, we will analyze the data from Sendell-Price et al. (2021). I am providing two relevant files: price_genos.geno is the genotypes file for a subset of the SNP markers used in the paper price_pops.csv is a file with the sampling location info for each indidividual included in the genotypes file. Note that they are in the same order as in the genotypes file. 4.5.1 Homework 4: Write a script that does the following: Read in the metadata file. Print a table showing how many individuals we have from each population. Run the clustering analysis using the snmf command. Create a cross-entropy plot. Get a Q matrix for K=5 (used in the paper). Add sample IDs from the metadata file as rownames to the Q matrix. Print the head of the Q matrix. For the “TAS” population, what are the average ancestry proportions from each cluster? Plot the ancestry barplot with populations labelled at the bottom. Color palette is up to you :) "],["haplotype-networks.html", "Week 5 Haplotype networks 5.1 Indexing 5.2 Using table to count across multiple columns 5.3 Creating a haplotype network 5.4 Homework", " Week 5 Haplotype networks 5.1 Indexing Today we’ll use the “Arthritis” dataset from the vcd package to learn some functions. Let’s install it: install.packages(&quot;vcd&quot;) library(vcd) data(Arthritis) ?Arthritis head(Arthritis) ## ID Treatment Sex Age Improved ## 1 57 Treated Male 27 Some ## 2 46 Treated Male 29 None ## 3 77 Treated Male 30 None ## 4 17 Treated Male 32 Marked ## 5 36 Treated Male 46 Marked ## 6 23 Treated Male 58 Marked   R and other programing languages use “indexing” to subset data. Indexing uses the order of entries (for example values in a vector or rows in a dataframe) to isolate particular entries. We’ve already used indexing to subset, maybe without even knowing it. For example, we know the command below gives us the first through fourth rows and the first through third columns. The numbers inside the brackes are called “indexes.” Arthritis[1:4,1:3] ## ID Treatment Sex ## 1 57 Treated Male ## 2 46 Treated Male ## 3 77 Treated Male ## 4 17 Treated Male   We can also use indexing to subet by a certain criteria. The command which returns indexes for all entries that meet a certain criteria. We saw a similar effect last week when we used which.max, but which is a more general command: ind &lt;- which(Arthritis$Sex==&quot;Male&quot;) ind ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 This gives us the indexes of the rows in the Arthritis data frame where the patient was male. If we want to retrieve these rows, we can use that vector to pull out those rows: Arthritis[ind,] ## ID Treatment Sex Age Improved ## 1 57 Treated Male 27 Some ## 2 46 Treated Male 29 None ## 3 77 Treated Male 30 None ## 4 17 Treated Male 32 Marked ## 5 36 Treated Male 46 Marked ## 6 23 Treated Male 58 Marked ## 7 75 Treated Male 59 None ## 8 39 Treated Male 59 Marked ## 9 33 Treated Male 63 None ## 10 55 Treated Male 63 None ## 11 30 Treated Male 64 None ## 12 5 Treated Male 64 Some ## 13 63 Treated Male 69 None ## 14 83 Treated Male 70 Marked ## 42 9 Placebo Male 37 None ## 43 14 Placebo Male 44 None ## 44 73 Placebo Male 50 None ## 45 74 Placebo Male 51 None ## 46 25 Placebo Male 52 None ## 47 18 Placebo Male 53 None ## 48 21 Placebo Male 59 None ## 49 52 Placebo Male 59 None ## 50 45 Placebo Male 62 None ## 51 41 Placebo Male 62 None ## 52 8 Placebo Male 63 Marked Note that we could have just as easily done this: Arthritis[Arthritis$Sex==&quot;Male&quot;,] When you do a command like this R finds the indexes and returns the rows for you, without you having to think about indexes. However, it can still be useful to know how indexes work, as we will see in the section today.       5.2 Using table to count across multiple columns Previously we used the table function to count the number of times each value was observed in a specific column. Today we’ll use the same function to create a matrix of counts across two different variables. First let’s get some data. Install the package vcd, load the library and pull up the Arthritis dataset: Notice that several of the columns are categorical. That means we can count how many times a certain category shows up. Before, we made a table with just one column, like this: table(Arthritis$Improved) ## ## None Some Marked ## 42 14 28 But what if we want to sort by another factor simultaneously. For example, we can see improvement based on treatment: table(Arthritis$Treatment,Arthritis$Improved) ## ## None Some Marked ## Placebo 29 7 7 ## Treated 13 7 21       5.3 Creating a haplotype network Today we will use mtDNA sequences from an example dataset to learn to create a haplotype network. The package we will use is called pegas. Install this package and load the library. install.packages(&quot;pegas&quot;) library(pegas) We will take advantage of a dataset called woodmouse that is part of the pegas package: data(woodmouse) woodmouse ## 15 DNA sequences in binary format stored in a matrix. ## ## All sequences of same length: 965 ## ## Labels: ## No305 ## No304 ## No306 ## No0906S ## No0908S ## No0909S ## ... ## ## Base composition: ## a c g t ## 0.307 0.261 0.126 0.306 ## (Total: 14.47 kb) Notice that woodmouse only has 15 individuals. We want to work with a few more, so we will artificially expand the dataset. We can do this by sampling with replacement using the command sample. Here we create a vector of the numbers 1:15, randomly sampled 100 times. We use that to choose individuals to sample (some multiple times) from the woodmouse dataset: data &lt;- woodmouse[sample(1:15,size=100,replace=T),] data ## 100 DNA sequences in binary format stored in a matrix. ## ## All sequences of same length: 965 ## ## Labels: ## No0913S ## No1007S ## No305 ## No0912S ## No1202S ## No1206S ## ... ## ## Base composition: ## a c g t ## 0.306 0.261 0.126 0.306 ## (Total: 96.5 kb)   Now we have 100 individuals! First, let’s make up some metadata that we can use later. You can use the labels function to pull sample names out of data. We will also assign each sample to a random “north” or “south” location. loc &lt;- sample(c(&quot;north&quot;,&quot;south&quot;),100,replace=T) names &lt;- labels(data) meta &lt;- data.frame(cbind(names,loc)) head(meta) ## names loc ## 1 No0913S north ## 2 No1007S north ## 3 No305 south ## 4 No0912S north ## 5 No1202S north ## 6 No1206S north NOTE: If we were doing this on real data, we would usually read in the populations from a spreadsheet. Here we just make them up to illustrate how the process works!   When we sequence DNA, some individuals will have the same haplotype. So the first step is to check how many haplotypes there are and which individuals share haplotypes. We do this with the haplotype function: hap &lt;- haplotype(data) hap ## ## Haplotypes extracted from: data ## ## Number of haplotypes: 15 ## Sequence length: 965 ## ## Haplotype labels and frequencies: ## ## I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV ## 11 10 9 5 7 6 4 4 6 9 6 9 4 5 5   In the output you can see the frequencies of each of the 15 haplotypes. Now we want a list of which individuals have which haplotypes: hapInfo &lt;- stack(setNames(attr(hap,&quot;index&quot;),rownames(hap))) head(hapInfo) ## values ind ## 1 1 I ## 2 14 I ## 3 33 I ## 4 48 I ## 5 53 I ## 6 59 I This command is a bit complicated. Briefly, it takes a list of individuals for each haplotype, and makes a dataframe that tells you which individual has which haplotype. The tricky part is that it returns the indexes of the individuals, not their actual data. Let’s change the column names to make more sense: names(hapInfo) &lt;- c(&quot;index&quot;,&quot;haplotype&quot;)   Now, we can use that index to merge the meta dataframe with the hapInfo data frame: merged &lt;- data.frame(cbind(hapInfo,meta[hapInfo$index,])) head(merged) ## index haplotype names loc ## 1 1 I No0913S north ## 14 14 I No0913S south ## 33 33 I No0913S north ## 48 48 I No0913S north ## 53 53 I No0913S north ## 59 59 I No0913S south   Great! Now lets start to make a haplotype network! This is pretty simple in pegas using the haploNet function. Below we plot the network for out haplotype set hap. We use the “freq” attribute to size the circles so that each circle is proportional to the number of samples with that haplotype: net &lt;- haploNet(hap) plot(net,size=attr(net,&quot;freq&quot;)) Cool, now we want to add colors. Take a look at the haploNet help page, paying particular attention to the pie argument: ?haploNet   So what we need is a matrix where rows are the different haplotypes and columns are the different locations. We can use the merged dataframe we made above along with the table command to produce this matrix: pie &lt;- table(merged$haplotype,merged$loc) head(pie) ## ## north south ## I 5 6 ## II 6 4 ## III 5 4 ## IV 5 0 ## V 2 5 ## VI 4 2 This table shows, for each haplotype, how many individuals come from the north and how many come from the south. Remember, this is completely made up data so we don’t expect any pattern here. Now we can use this to color the circles in the haplotype network, including adding a legend:   plot(net,size=attr(net,&quot;freq&quot;),pie=pie) legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, colnames(pie), col=rainbow(ncol(pie)), pch=19, ncol=2) 5.4 Homework   For homework you will create a haplotype network using the mtDNA data from Cliff et al. (2015). Here are the files you will need: cliff_metadata.csv contains sample IDs along with population information and haplotype inferred within the paper cliff_mtDNA.fasta contains mtDNA sequences from the paper.   5.4.1 Homework 5: Write a script that does the following: Read in the fasta file “mtDNA.fa” and the metadata file “metadata.csv” (hint: to read the .fa file you will use the command read.dna with argument format=“fasta”) Create a haplotype network (no colors) Create a table that shows the number of each haplotype in each population Create a haplotype network (with colors) Add a legend (this might look messy - that’s okay) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
